#          This is a <mark>Jekyll</mark> theme that I have recently created, in fact it is what this resume has been built with.
#          I decided I wanted to learn how to create a fully open source project and thought that this would be the perfect project to do this with.
#          It has allowed me to share something I have created in a way that will be helpful for lots of people while also learning from this myself.

#          itsgoingto.be is a simple voting site where a user can ask a question or topic top put to a vote. This question
#          can then be shared with their friends/colleagues to vote on things like 'Where should we go for lunch?'.

#          The API for this site has been build using <mark>Node.js</mark> while the front end is a <mark>React</mark>/<mark>Redux</mark> app.
#          I have used <mark>Docker</mark> to set up a development environment and <mark>Heroku</mark> to deploy and host the site. I have
#          a suite of unit and API tests for the backend and unit tests for the front end.
#          I have been using this project as a way to increase many of my skills and also learn new things, most recently sockets and Node.JS. I have particually
#          enjoyed managing my own project and designing my own architecture and implementing this to a high standard.
#          Feel free to check out the whole project on GitHub to get a feel for how I work [here](https://github.com/sproogen/itsgoingto.be).

          During my degree at Bristol University I learnt lots of key skills such as team work and project management. Although
          we mainly focused on software development and the principles of programming I use a lot of these skills to
          my advantage in my day to day work.
          While at Bristol Uni I spent a lot of my free time with the Kitesurfing society. I spent 3 years on the committee
          as a secretary, trip rep and then media and promotions manager. During this time I took on roles from organising
          transport and designing posters to organising a trip to Portugal for over 30 students.
  - title: When I'm Not Programming
    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      When I'm not sat at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. I do a lot a sports such as
      mountain biking, road cycling, kitesuring and horse riding as well as trying to make time for things like
      rock climbing and playing some rugby. I currently have 2 horses and find this is a great way to get out of the house
      and taking my mind of things while learing to showjump.
      I'm interested in photography and videography as I like to be creative, this is mainly through sport but
      I enjoy landscape and abstract photography too. I like to showcase my work on instagram if
      you would like to take a look - [jameswgrant](https://www.instagram.com/jameswgrant/).
      Finally during the rest of my free time you will either find me working on my bikes, rock climbing at one of
      Bristol's indoor climbing centres or down 'The Rec' supporting Bath Rugby.
